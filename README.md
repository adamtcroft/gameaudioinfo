## What is this page?

This page is a practical guide to breaking into game audio. It pulls together a lot of the questions I hear most often and organizes them into something you can actually work through.

The emphasis here is on **accessible, actionable learning**. You do not need a studio, a degree, or a specific job title to start. If you're building your first demo reel, trying to understand what jobs even exist, or wondering how anyone ever gets noticed by a studio, this is for you.

This is a large, opinionated repository of ideas, checklists, and next steps you can try in the real world.

<a id="how-to-use-this-page"></a>
## How to use this page

You do not have to read this front to back.

If you're **brand new to game audio**:
- Skim [What are the different roles in game audio?](#what-are-the-different-roles-in-game-audio).
- Read [What gear/software should I use?](#what-gear-software-should-i-use) and pick one DAW to start with.
- Start a small project that could turn into your first [demo reel](#what-makes-a-good-demo-reel) piece.
- Then read [How do I actually "network"?](#how-do-i-actually-network) and [How do I get started in indie games?](#how-do-i-get-started-in-indie-games).

If you're an **audio person coming from film, music, or broadcast**:
- Read [What are the different roles in game audio?](#what-are-the-different-roles-in-game-audio) and decide which role you want first.
- Focus on [What makes a good demo reel?](#what-makes-a-good-demo-reel) and [How do I get the attention of AAA studios?](#how-do-i-get-the-attention-of-aaa-studios).
- Use [How do I actually "network"?](#how-do-i-actually-network) to turn online and in-person events into real relationships.

Treat this page like a menu of next steps. You can bounce around, come back, and update your plan over time.

<a id="who-is-this-page-for"></a>
## Who is this page for?

This page is designed to provide learning materials and practical advice for:
- **Students** curious about a career in game audio.
- **Audio professionals** making the leap from other industries, such as film, music, or broadcasting.
- **Self-taught hobbyists** who love games first and are now getting serious about sound.

If you're somewhere on the spectrum from "I have no idea where to start" to "I keep applying and not hearing back", you're in the right place.

<a id="should-you-pursue-a-career-in-game-audio"></a>
## Should you pursue a career in game audio?

A career in game audio can be amazing, but it's not for everyone. A few things to think about:

- **Do you enjoy making games, or just playing them?**
  - Try a game jam, a tiny prototype, or a mod. If you hate the messy, collaborative, unfinished nature of making a game, that's important data.
- **How long might this actually take?**
  - For most people, landing a first serious role is measured in **years**, not weeks. You can do great work along the way, but it is not an overnight path.
- **Are you willing to be a beginner again?**
  - If you're already good at music, film, or post, you will still need to be bad at interactive audio and tools for a while. That's normal.
- **Location, visas, and age.**
  - Big studios often cluster in major cities and countries with tricky visa requirements. Remote and indie work is more flexible, but you may still need to adapt.
  - People break into game audio in their 30s, 40s, and beyond. Age is less important than portfolio, reliability, and attitude—but you should plan your finances and timeline realistically.

If you read this section and still feel pulled toward game audio, that's a good sign.

<a id="how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-game-audio-job"></a>
## How long does it take to get a game audio job?

There is no single guaranteed timeline, but you should expect this to take **years, not weeks**.

A few rough patterns:
- If you're starting from scratch in both audio and games, it can easily take **2–5 years** of steady work to build skills, a portfolio, and connections.
- If you already work in audio (music, film, post), you may move faster, but you'll still need time to learn tools, implementation, and game thinking.
- If you can only work nights and weekends, assume things will move more slowly than someone treating this like a full-time apprenticeship.

This doesn't mean you "wait" years with nothing to show for it. You can:
- Ship jam games, mods, and small indie projects.
- Build a reel and update it as you improve.
- Make friends and collaborators in the space.

Think of it like training for a long hike, not sprinting across a parking lot.

## Who created this?

Hi, I'm [Adam T. Croft](https://adamtcroft.com).

I've been working in audio and entertainment since 2005 and shipped my first game work around 2010–2011. Since then I've worked with teams at Xbox, 343, EA, Bungie, and other studios in both internal and external roles.

I also write and teach about game audio careers. At [nir.media](https://nir.media) you'll find resources like **Quit Aspiring, Vol. 1** and **Quit Aspiring, Vol. 2**, plus courses and tools aimed at helping you build a real, sustainable career instead of just collecting advice.

<a id="what-gear-software-should-I-use"></a>
## What gear/software should I use?

Before listing out equipment and software, let's make one thing clear: you probably have everything you need to start.

If you have a phone and a pair of headphones, you can make music, sound effects, and voice over. Will they sound like someone who has years of experience and a big studio? No. But that's not the goal at the beginning.

Some of the most memorable work out there has been recorded on phones, edited on laptops, and listened to on earbuds around the world. Expensive tools don't automatically make you a better or more creative artist—they just give you different options.

So, **don't go buying a bunch of stuff yet**. There are plenty of free and cheap tools you can use right now. Over time, you're likely to slowly invest in things like:

### A DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)
* Audacity
* REAPER
* Ableton
* Pro Tools
* Nuendo
* Cubase

Pick one that feels approachable and stick with it long enough to finish a few projects.

### An Audio Interface
* Focusrite

There are many options, but almost any entry-level interface from a reputable brand will get you started.

### Headphones
* Any headphones you already have
* Sony MDR-7506

Use what you have first. Upgrade later when you know what actually bothers you about your current setup.

### A Microphone
* Your phone
* SM58
* A basic shotgun microphone

Again, start simple. A phone and a dynamic mic can carry you a long way.

### Game Engines
* Learn literally any game engine by making a simple demo game or participating in a game jam.
* You don't **need** to make a game, but if you do, do it for fun and learning.
* Unreal, Unity, Godot, or GameMaker can all be great starting points.

### Audio Middleware
* If you want to work in AAA, it's close to a requirement to learn **Audiokinetic Wwise**.
* Some indies and titles like Forza use **FMOD**.
* For smaller or indie projects, you might not need middleware at all.

### Source Control
* Learn the basics of **Git**.
* Do a few tutorials to understand GitHub and GitHub Desktop.

<a id="what-are-the-different-roles-in-game-audio"></a>
## What are the different roles in game audio?

There isn't just one "game audio job". A few of the common roles:

- **Sound Designer**
  - Creates and implements sound effects, UI sounds, and in-game audio moments.
- **Technical Sound Designer**
  - Lives at the intersection of sound and systems: integration, scripting, middleware setups, and in-engine behaviors.
- **Composer**
  - Writes and produces music that supports gameplay, narrative, and pacing, often in interactive or layered formats.
- **Audio Programmer**
  - Builds audio systems, tools, and features in code; works closely with engineers and audio teams.
- **Dialogue / VO Designer or Director**
  - Handles casting, recording, editing, and implementation of dialogue and vocal content.
- **Audio Lead / Audio Director**
  - Guides the overall audio vision, manages the team, and makes calls on priorities and quality.

You don't have to pick perfectly on day one, but you should **aim your learning and portfolio at one role first** so people know what to hire you for.

<a id="how-is-interactive-game-audio-different-from-linear-audio"></a>
## How is interactive game audio different from linear audio?

If you're coming from film, TV, or music, game audio can feel upside down at first.

Some key differences:
- **Non-linear vs linear.**
  - In linear work, you design for a fixed timeline. In games, the player controls pacing, repetition, and even whether your sounds play at all.
- **Systems vs single renders.**
  - You're often building systems (states, parameters, blend trees) that generate audio behavior, not just a single final mix.
- **Implementation is part of the job.**
  - In games, "putting sounds in" (middleware and engine work) is as important as designing the sounds themselves.
- **Mixing is dynamic.**
  - You don't mix one final bounce; you design how the mix responds to gameplay over time.

Good ways to get a feel for this:
- Rebuild the audio for a short gameplay clip using Wwise or FMOD and a free engine.
- Take a simple action (like footsteps or a gunshot) and make it feel different based on surface, context, or player state.

<a id="do-i-need-to-learn-to-code"></a>
## Do I need to learn to code?

Short answer: **not always**, but it helps a lot.

You can do great work as a sound designer or composer without being a programmer. However:

- If you want to be a **technical sound designer** or **audio programmer**, some coding or scripting is expected.
- Even as a sound designer, being comfortable with basic logic (states, parameters, switches) and simple scripts can make you much easier to work with.

Good starting points:
- Follow a beginner tutorial that walks through hooking sounds up in Unity or Unreal.
- Learn simple scripting in a tool you already use (for example, basic scripting in REAPER).
- Get used to reading error messages and fixing simple integration issues.

You don't need to become a full-time software engineer, but treating code as another creative tool will open doors.

<a id="do-i-need-a-masters-degree"></a>
## Do I need a master's degree?

In most cases, **no**.

Studios primarily hire based on:
- The quality and relevance of your work.
- Your ability to collaborate and communicate.
- Your reliability and follow-through.

A degree can help if:
- You want structured time and mentorship to focus on audio.
- You get access to good facilities, peers, and networking opportunities.

Be cautious if:
- The program is extremely expensive and does not have a clear track record of graduates working in games.
- You're hoping the degree itself will guarantee you a job.

If you do go to school, treat it as one tool among many—not the whole strategy.

<a id="why-soft-skills-matter-more-than-audio-skills"></a>
## Why soft skills matter more than audio skills

Your audio skills need to be good—but past a certain point, **soft skills** decide who gets hired and who keeps getting called back.

Soft skills that matter a lot:
- **Communication.** You can explain what you're doing, ask good questions, and respond to feedback without getting defensive.
- **Reliability.** You do what you say you'll do, when you said you'd do it—or you communicate early when something slips.
- **Collaboration.** You can work with designers, engineers, artists, and producers without making everything about audio.
- **Adaptability.** You can handle changes in direction, scope, and priorities without melting down.

Studios would rather teach a reliable, collaborative person how to fix a bus compressor than force a genius mixer to answer emails.

<a id="what-makes-a-good-demo-reel"></a>
## What makes a good demo reel?

A good game audio reel is **focused, short, and easy to understand**.

Things to aim for:
- **Length:** 1–3 minutes is usually enough.
- **Clarity:** The audio should be clear, punchy, and at a reasonable loudness.
- **Context:** Show audio in the context of gameplay or cutscenes when possible.
- **Variety:** Include a few different types of work (e.g., combat, ambience, UI, music) that match the roles you want.
- **Labeling:** Make it obvious what you did—use on-screen text or a description.

A simple first reel plan:
- Pick 3–5 short clips (5–20 seconds each).
- Replace or create audio for each clip.
- Edit them back-to-back with clean transitions and basic labeling.

<a id="how-do-i-write-resumes-and-cover-letters-for-game-audio"></a>
## How do I write resumes and cover letters for game audio?

Your resume and cover letter are **supporting tools**, not the main event. Their job is to make it easy for someone to understand who you are, what you do, and why you might fit.

For resumes:
- Keep it to **one page** in most cases.
- Lead with a short summary that clearly states your target role (e.g., "Junior Game Sound Designer").
- Emphasize **projects and outcomes**, not just responsibilities.
- Make it skimmable: clear headings, bullet points, consistent formatting.

For cover letters:
- Think of them as a short note answering three questions:
  - Who are you and what role are you applying for?
  - Why this studio / project specifically?
  - What 1–3 relevant things have you done that show you can do this job?
- Avoid generic hype; be specific and human.

You don't need to rewrite everything from scratch each time. Build a solid base version, then customize a few lines for each application.

<a id="how-do-i-actually-network"></a>
## How do I actually "network"?

Think of networking as **making friends in your field**, not collecting business cards.

Practical ways to do that:
- Join a few relevant Discord servers or online communities and participate in conversations.
- Attend local meetups, conferences, or game jams when you can.
- Share small pieces of work regularly instead of waiting for a "perfect" project.
- When you reach out to someone, be specific and respectful of their time.

You don't have to be loud or extroverted. Consistency, curiosity, and kindness go a long way.

<a id="how-do-i-get-the-attention-of-aaa-studios"></a>
## How do I get the attention of AAA studios?

- **Know where you want to work.**
  - Make a short list of studios and study the kinds of games they make.
- **Make a lot of work.**
  - Small, finished projects beat one giant, unfinished "masterpiece".
- **Use short, focused examples.**
  - 3–5 second highlights can show punch, clarity, and style very quickly.
- **Build a strong demo reel.**
  - Tailor at least part of it to the types of games and roles you are applying for.
- **Network in-person and online.**
  - Let people see your work and your improvement over time.
- **Apply to jobs consistently.**
  - Rejection is normal. Use it as feedback to adjust your reel, resume, and targets.

<a id="how-do-i-get-started-in-indie-games"></a>
## How do I get started in indie games?

- **Know what style of game you want to work on.**
  - Platformers, narrative games, strategy, horror, mobile—each community hangs out in slightly different places.
- **Make a lot of work.**
  - Just like with AAA, frequent, finished small projects matter more than one giant one.
- **Use short, focused examples.**
  - 3–5 second clips and GIFs with sound are easy to share.
- **Network in-person and online (especially Discord).**
  - Many indie teams form in communities and during jams.
- **Reach out to developers you genuinely like.**
  - Share why you enjoy their work and how you might be able to help in a realistic, scoped way.
