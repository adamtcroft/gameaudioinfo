## Who created this?
Hi, I’m Adam T. Croft.  I’ve been working in various forms of audio and entertainment since 2005, and worked on my first video game in either 2010 or 2011 (Destiny before it was known as Destiny…)

I’ve worked with Xbox, 343, EA, and Bungie internally, as well as other studios as an external resource.  I’ve written two books on how to break into a game audio career, launched multiple courses on audio and programming, mentored a ton of folks, and hired/built an entire team inside Bungie.

## Who can contribute?
Anyone!  I’ve setup gameaudio.info as a page on GitHub internationally so that **YOU** can add to it.

Is contributing as easy as writing in a Google Doc or wiki page?  Nope, but that too is intentional.

As game developers, at some point we’re required to learn to use a tool called “source control”.  Most big studios use a tool called Perforce.  It’s expensive and you have to host it yourself - so it’s not feasible to learn alone.

Git, however, and by proxy GitHub, are free and open to anyone.  To contribute to this page, the ONE significant requirement is that you learn enough about Git/source control concepts, that you learn to clone the repository, make a change, and push it.

Don’t worry, if all that is foreign to you, I’ve included a guide.

## What skills do I need to start?

## What gear/software should I use?
Before listing out equipment and software, let’s make one thing super clear - you probably have everything you already need to get started.

If you have a phone and a pair of headphones, you can make music, sound effects, and voice over.  Will they be as perfect as someone who has years of experience and a big studio?  Of course not, but those expectations are unrealistic.

Some of the most amazing content has been recorded on a phone, edited by laptops, and listened to on earbuds around the planet.  Expensive tools don’t MAKE you a better and more creative artist, they ease the pain and lessen the difficult you must endure to get a high quality product done quickly.

So, **don’t go buying stuff yet** - there are plenty of free and cheap tools you can use right now.

So, you’re likely to slowly invest in the following:

### A DAW
* Audacity
* REAPER
* Ableton
* Pro Tools
* Nuendo
* Cubase

### An Audio Interface
* Focusrite

### Headphones
* Any headpphones you already have
* Sony MDR-7506

### A Microphone
* Your Phone
* SM58
* Cheap Shotgun

## Game Engines
* Learn literally any game engine by making a simple demo game or participating 
  in a game jam
* You don't **need** to make a game, but you can, and if you do you then you 
  should do it for fun
* Unreal, Unity, Godot, or GameMaker can be great starting points

## Audio Middleware
* If you want to work in AAA, it's a near requirement to learn **Audiokinetic 
  Wwise**
* Some indies and Forza titles use FMOD
* You can also consider not using Middleware for smaller and indie games

## Source Control
* The only thing you can learn for free is Git
* Do some tutorials to learn the basics of GitHub and GitHub Desktop

## How do I get the attention of AAA studios?
* Know where you want to work
* Make stuff a lot
* Short 3-5 second reels
* A demo reel
* Network in-person and online
* Apply to jobs

## How do I get started in indie games?
* Know what style of game you want to work on
* Make stuff a lot
* Short 3-5 second reels
* Network in-person and online (Discord)
* Reach out to developers you like
