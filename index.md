If you have a phone and a pair of headphones, you can make music, sound effects, and voice over.  Will they be as perfect as someone who has years of experience and a big studio?  Of course not, b...

Some of the most amazing content has been recorded on a phone, edited by laptops, and listened to on earbuds around the planet.  Expensive tools don't MAKE you a better and more creative artist,[...

So, **don't go buying stuff yet** - there are plenty of free and cheap tools you can use right now.

So, you're likely to slowly invest in the following:

### A DAW
* Audacity
* REAPER
* Ableton

### Headphones
* Any headpphones you already have

* Learn literally any game engine by making a simple demo game or participating 
  in a game jam
* You don't **need** to make a game, but you can, and if you do you then you
