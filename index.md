## Who created this?
Hi, I’m Adam T. Croft.  I’ve been working in various forms of audio and entertainment since 2005, and worked on my first video game in either 2010 or 2011 (Destiny before it was known as Destiny…)

I’ve worked with Xbox, 343, EA, and Bungie internally, as well as other studios as an external resource.  I’ve written two books on how to break into a game audio career, launched multiple courses on audio and programming, mentored a ton of folks, and hired/built an entire team inside Bungie.

## Who can contribute?
Anyone!  I’ve setup gameaudio.info as a page on GitHub internationally so that YOU can add to it.

Is contributing as easy as writing in a Google Doc or wiki page?  Nope, but that too is intentional.

As game developers, at some point we’re required to learn to use a tool called “source control”.  Most big studios use a tool called Perforce.  It’s expensive and you have to host it yourself - so it’s not feasible to learn alone.

Git, however, and by proxy GitHub, are free and open to anyone.  To contribute to this page, the ONE significant requirement is that you learn enough about Git/source control concepts, that you learn to clone the repository, make a change, and push it.

Don’t worry, if all that is foreign to you, I’ve included a guide.
